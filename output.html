            <strong>What is a Malignant Case in Lung Cancer?</strong><br>
            A malignant lung cancer case refers to a condition where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and invade nearby tissues. Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body 
            through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Early detection and treatment are critical to improving survival rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Malignant lung cancer is commonly linked to factors like smoking, prolonged exposure to pollutants, and genetic predisposition. Common symptoms include persistent coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
            and unexplained weight loss.
