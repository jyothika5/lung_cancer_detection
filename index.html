            <h2>What is Lung Cancer?</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably in the lungs, leading to the formation of tumors. 
                It interferes with the normal functioning of the lungs, which are vital for oxygen exchange in the body.
                Smoking, air pollution, and exposure to harmful substances are major contributors to this disease. 
                Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest types of cancer worldwide, but early detection and advancements in medical technology have improved survival rates.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Types of Lung Cancer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):</strong> The most common type, making up about 85% of cases. It includes subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):</strong> A less common but aggressive form of lung cancer, typically associated with smoking.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Malignant vs. Benign Lung Cases</h2>
            <p>
                Lung abnormalities or nodules can be categorized as either malignant or benign:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malignant:</strong> Cancerous tumors that grow rapidly, invade nearby tissues, and may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Benign:</strong> Non-cancerous growths that do not spread or invade other tissues. These may still require monitoring or treatment to ensure they do not impact lung function.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Stages of Lung Cancer</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer progresses through distinct stages, each requiring different treatment approaches:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stage I:</strong> Cancer is localized and confined to the lungs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage II:</strong> The tumor grows larger and may spread to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage III:</strong> Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the chest or nearby organs.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage IV:</strong> Cancer has metastasized, spreading to distant organs like the brain, liver, or bones.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                Lung cancer symptoms may vary depending on the stage of the disease. Common symptoms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent cough that doesnt go away</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                <li>Chest pain, especially during deep breathing or coughing</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss and fatigue</li>
                <li>Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum</li>
                <li>Hoarseness or changes in voice</li>
                <li>Frequent lung infections like bronchitis or pneumonia</li>
            </ul>
